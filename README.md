[cite_start]I am an undergraduate student at **Seoul National University**, majoring in **Rural Systems Engineering** with an interdisciplinary major in **Artificial Intelligence** and a minor in **Electrical & Computer Engineering**[cite: 5, 6, 7].

My research interests lie in **Computer Vision, Generative AI, and Efficient Computing**. [cite_start]Specifically, I am interested in developing efficient models for mobile/edge devices and applying generative models (Stable Diffusion) for precise image editing[cite: 13, 19].

[cite_start]Previously, I worked as an undergraduate intern at the **Networked Computing Lab**, studying model binarization and mobile clustering[cite: 11, 13]. [cite_start]I also have experience in quantum computing, having implemented Renyi entropy estimation using classical shadow, which led to winning 1st place in the Quantum AI Contest[cite: 21, 23].
